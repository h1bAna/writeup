Try to connect 1337 port and you can get the flag.
This is a pwnable challenge rather than priviledge escaping.
DO NOT try to gain the priviledge.
If you find a way to get the flag without pwning (for example, misconfigured Dockerfile),
contact the administrator and you can get a special achievement. :)
